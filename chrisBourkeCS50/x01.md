preprocessor directives

-  are directives to the compiler to do something before compiling

- you can bring or "include" external libaries

- example, #include <math.h>




can also define "macros"

- examplel, #define GRAVITYCONSTANT 1000

- a macro is using #define, is essentially a cut-and-paste

- why?
    - it allows as to use identifiers for constant values
    - using macros avoids "magic numbers", whose purpose is not immediately clear
    - can be used as constants in scientific computing
